# Baseball Buddy
The Baseball Buddy Discord Bot is the ultimate baseball bot for Discord. Using Python, Python third-party library "pybaseball", the Discord, GIPHY, and Tenor APIs, and Google Gemini, it provides a seamless and fun experience for all of its users. It is currently deployed in multiple servers with more than 1000+ users total.

This idea arose from my original Twitter/X Bot concept (@SeasonRandom). Since then, X API usage has been severely limited and, as such, requires developers to spend at least $100/month for basic access to X's v2 API. As a result, I pivoted towards Discord to make my dreams of creating a Baseball Bot a reality.

**Functionality (As of 06/03/2024)**
1. /hello, /goodbye, /ping: These commands are simply test commands that I added at the beginning of bot development in order to ensure that the bot is working properly.

2. /playerlookup: This command uses the pybaseball library to allow the user to look up any baseball player that has played in Major League Baseball. When prompted, it returns the player's career span, as well as the player's profiles on MLB.com, Retrosheet, Baseball-Reference, and Fangraphs.

3. /randomgifgiphy, /randomgiftenor: These two commands use GIPHY API & Tenor API respectively to produce a random gift based on the user's query.
  
4. /randomstatement: This command is directly inspired by the former X Bot @mlbshitpostbot. It originally produced random statements from random players and prompts. As a baseball fan, this bot was a staple in Twitter's/X's Baseball community.
  
5. /funfact: This command uses Google Gemini to generate fun facts about baseball.

Soon, I hope to add additional functionality to the bot, such as...
-live scores
-game summaries/results
-trivia
-etc.

Be on the look out for updates!
